      <h2>Class Exercise / Critiquing data graphics</h2>
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To gain experience of the
          different types of data graphics commonly
          encountered; &nbsp;</li>
        <li>To critically assess
          data graphics;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>To practice your
          presentation skills and team work.&nbsp;</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>In a nutshell...</h3>
      <p>Your task is, in small groups,
        to seek out a variety of interesting or thought-provoking data
        graphics, and critically analyze these. You will report
        back to the class by presenting to the class the best and worst
        instance you found, explaining your analysis to the class, and
        be
        prepared to answer questions on your chosen instances.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>The fine print...</h3>
      <p>You should complete this
        exercise in groups of between 2 and 4 people. You should
        organize
        yourselves into groups.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You can then split your task
        into three stages.</p>
      <h4>Stage 1: Collect and collate a
        corpus of data graphics</h4>
      <p>Use your resourcefulness to
        find and survey a small corpus of
        data graphics. You may find it useful to visit the library, to
        read the papers, browse the magazines in your local newsagent,
        or
        simply look around your home or classroom, as well as of course
        search
        the Internet. </p>
      <h4>Stage 2: Critically analyze
        your corpus&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>Critically assess your corpus,
        using the principles covered in the
        lecture (four principles of data graphics, visual variables and
        value messages, etc.). From your analysis, identify the one of
        the&nbsp;best
        and
        one of the worst data graphics in your corpus, and refine your
        analysis as necessary. &nbsp;</p>
      <h4>Stage 3: Present your
        findings&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>You must upload your
        best/worst graphic to the course Wiki, along with a brief
        (&lt;100
        word)
        explanation of your analysis.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Groups may also orally present
        findings to the whole class. Each
        group will have a few minutes briefly to present either their
        best
        or worst interface/graphics and to summarize their analysis and
        justifications for the choice. You will be able to access your
        graphic/interface via the Wiki (no powerpoint, no bullet
        points). You
        should be prepared to answer questions on your choices and
        analysis, as
        well as support other presenters by asking questions about their
        choices. &nbsp;</p>
