      <h2>Lab / Data Graphics with Spreadsheets<br>
      </h2>
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To gain experience of the different types of charts and
          graphs commonly used to display data;&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>To critically assess charts and graphs in terms of the four
          principles of data graphics;&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>To practice iterative redesign of data graphics.&nbsp;</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>In a nutshell...</h3>
      <p>Your task is to use public data on urban development in
        Melbourne to explore the range of charts and graphs you can
        construct with Google Sheets. You should begin to form the habit
        of assessing critically each chart you see in terms of the four
        principles of data graphics: data density, data correspondence,
        data integrity, and aesthetics. <br>
      </p>
      <h3>The fine print...</h3>
      <p>You can complete this exercise individually, but ideally you
        should work with a classmate, and discuss together your work.
        You can start in the supervised lab session and continue as
        required in your own time. The exercise is split into 5 stages:
        getting the data, your first data graphic, critically assessing
        your data graphic, a more complex data graphic, and putting it
        all together.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <h4>Stage 1: Get the data into Google Sheets<br>
      </h4>
      <p>First, you will need to load the tabular data on urban
        development in Melbourne, used as a running example throughout
        this course, into Google Sheets. There are a number of different
        ways to do this. One method is summarized below. If you are
        unfamiliar with Google Sheets and feel you need more assistance
        in getting started or just a refresher, you can work through the
        following Lynda training videos. Feel free to skip these if you
        are already comfortable with spreadsheets like Excel and Google
        Sheets.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is Google Sheets, <a
href="https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/What-Google-Sheets/163414/187745-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au">https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/What-Google-Sheets/163414/187745-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au</a></li>
        <li>Creating, naming, and saving a spreadsheet, <a
href="https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Creating-naming-saving-spreadsheet/163414/187750-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au">https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Creating-naming-saving-spreadsheet/163414/187750-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au</a></li>
        <li>Importing and converting .csv ... data and files, <a
href="https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Importing-converting-csv-tsv-tab-txt-data-files/163414/187756-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au">https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Importing-converting-csv-tsv-tab-txt-data-files/163414/187756-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au</a><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you are ready to begin working with your data: <br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the data in .csv (comma separated variable) format
          direct from the Development Activity Melbourne website <a
            href="http://developmentactivity.melbourne.vic.gov.au">http://developmentactivity.melbourne.vic.gov.au</a>.
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> Open a new Google Sheet in Google Drive <a
            href="http://drive.google.com">http://drive.google.com</a>
          ("New..." -&gt; "Google Spreadsheet"). <br>
        </li>
        <li>Import your downloaded .csv file into your Google
          spreadsheet ("File" -&gt; "Import" -&gt; "Upload").</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once you have your data uploaded, make sure you give your
        spreadsheet and the tab containing the data sensible names. Then
        have a look through your data, familiarize yourself with what is
        there. If you are in any doubt about what the different columns
        and data items mean, have a look through the metadata (literally
        "data about data") also accessible on the download site <a
          href="http://developmentactivity.melbourne.vic.gov.au">http://developmentactivity.melbourne.vic.gov.au</a>.
        What do you notice about the data? <br>
      </p>
      <h4>Stage 2: Your first data graphic<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Sometimes for small and clean data sets, viewing raw data in
        tables can be a quick way of understanding the data. However,
        even for moderately large and "messy" data sets (such as your
        data) you need a data graphic to help someone understand the
        patterns in the data. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We'll start by building a chart of the number of completed
        buildings by year. We'll repeat the procedure to do this, which
        involves first some reformatting and summarizing of the data,
        multiple times. So please ask for help in the lab if you get
        stuck or confused doing this. You may also find the following
        Lynda videos helpful if you need additional background
        assistance: <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using pivot tables, <a
href="https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Using-pivot-tables/163414/187786-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au">https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Using-pivot-tables/163414/187786-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au</a></li>
        <li>Creating charts in Google Sheets, <a
href="https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Using-pivot-tables/163414/187786-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au">https://www.lynda.com/Sheets-tutorials/Using-pivot-tables/163414/187786-4.html?org=rmit.edu.au</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you are ready to dive in, here's the procedure for
        summarizing your data with a pivot table:<br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select all your raw data (Stage 1) and insert a new pivot
          table ("Insert" -&gt; "Pivot table..."). A pivot table allows
          you to quickly summarize large data sets. <br>
        </li>
        <li>To summarize the years in which buildings were completed,
          add the "year_completed" field to the "Rows" of your pivot
          table. Sort ascending, and uncheck the "Show totals" box (it
          makes no sense to add together the years!)</li>
        <li>Next to summarize the status of the buildings, add the
          "status" field to the "Columns of your pivot table. Again,
          uncheck the "Show totals" box, it is not meaningful in this
          context. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Now we need to add some values into the table. The values we
          need are the counts of completed buildings. To do this, add
          the "status" field again, but this time to the "Values", and
          summarized by "COUNTA" (counts of buildings).</li>
        <li>Finally, the "year_completed" field is only relevant to
          buildings with "status" as "COMPLETED". So add a "Filter" with
          the "status" field, and only "COMPLETED" shown. <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Almost there! Now you are ready to chart your data. <br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the two columns, which should now contain your counts
          of completed buildings from 2002-2017. The "Insert" -&gt;
          "Chart..."</li>
        <li>You will now be presented with the Chart editor, which
          offers you a wide range of different options for how to
          present your data. Insert as a column chart with the default
          settings. <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Stage 3: Critically assess your data graphic<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Often (but not always) the defaults in Google Charts are quite
        sensible. (Note that this is usually <i>not</i> the case for
        most spreadsheet and mapping programs. As we will see in later
        weeks, the defaults are frequently quite <i>stupid</i>). But
        there are always choices, even with sensible defaults. Look
        critically at your data graphic and find:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>one problem with data density (hint: think "data/ink ratio")</li>
        <li>one problem with data integrity (hint: look carefully at
          your pivot table and then again at your chart)</li>
        <li>one problem with data correspondence (hint: how easy is it
          to compare the relative completed buildings in 2015 versus
          2006?)</li>
        <li>one problem with aesthetics (hint: in fact, the defaults for
          this simple chart pretty good, but think alignment, spacing,
          balance, could they be improved?)<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, explore different options for your chart using Google
        Sheets. Using the "Chart editor" (if it has disappeared either
        create a new chart or click on your existing chart and select
        "Edit..."):<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>find one way to make your data density <i>worse</i> and
          another way to make it <i>better</i>.<br>
        </li>
        <li>find one way to make your data integrity <i>worse</i> and
          another way to make it <i>better</i>.</li>
        <li>find one way to make your data correspondence <i>worse</i>
          and another way to make it <i>better</i>.</li>
        <li>find one way to make your aesthetics <i>worse</i> and
          another way to make them <i>better</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next explore the different <i>types</i> of chart, and compare
        these with your (best) column chart in terms of the four
        principles of data graphics. You should construct and compare: <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a bar chart,</li>
        <li>a line chart, <br>
        </li>
        <li>an area chart, <br>
        </li>
        <li>a scatterplot,</li>
        <li>a pie chart, and <br>
        </li>
        <li>a gauge chart (!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Note that in all cases the point of the exercise is not simply
        to construct the data graphic, but to critically assess its
        suitability (in terms of the four principles of data graphics)
        and begin to iteratively redesign your data graphic to improve
        it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For a bonus mark, you can export your best charts to an image,
        and upload them to the Lab 1 discussion board, along with a
        brief summary of why it is your best image, to share and comment
        with others in the class.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Stage 4: More complex data graphics<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Use the techniques you have learned to construct some more
        sophisticated data graphics showing: <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The total completed buildings by year by suburb, for the 5
          suburbs Carlton, Docklands, East Melbourne, North Melbourne,
          and Melbourne (CBD);<br>
        </li>
        <li> The number of bike spaces associated with developments
          applied, approved, completed, and under construction across
          different suburbs. <br>
        </li>
        <li>The total proportion of residential dwellings associated
          with developments applied for from each suburb. <br>
        </li>
        <li>The number of floors of all developments in Melbourne by
          year. You might also try to incorporate the different suburbs
          in this data graphics. (Hint: this does not require a pivot
          table, you should use the raw data, and Google Sheets'
          defaults are not a good choice).&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Again, in each cases critically assess your data graphic with
        reference to the four principles of data graphics, and
        iteratively redesign your data graphic to improve it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For a bonus mark, you can export your best charts to an image,
        and upload them to the Lab 1 discussion board, along with a
        brief summary of why it is your best image, to share and comment
        with others in the class.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>This practical exercise is not assessed. However, by sharing
        some of your best (and worst) data graphics (Stage 3/4) to the
        discussion forum, you can gain a bonus mark (1%). Note: there is
        a maximum total of 1 bonus mark on offer for this lab,
        irrespective of the number of posts on the forum. <br>
