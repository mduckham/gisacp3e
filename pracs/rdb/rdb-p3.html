<h2>P3:
Spatial Analysis<br>
</h2>
<h3>Objectives<br>
</h3>
<p>By the end of this practical
you should be able to: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>retrieve information about
objects based on their spatial
properties and relations; and</li>
  <li>analyse spatial relations of
several objects.</li>
</ol>
This practical should require <span style="font-style: italic;">two
weeks</span> to complete. <br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This practical will introduce
you to more advanced spatial analysis in SQL. We will use the spatial
capabilities of Oracle 10g DBMS to perform spatial operations and
analysis on
the sample
data from the US Census Bureau and the Digital Chart of the World
(covered
in Kothuri
et al., 2004).<br>
</p>
<h3>Exercise P3.1: Spatial
Analysis&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In the previous practicals you
should have learned how to
determine
the
basic
properties of (mostly) a single spatial object, and perform some simple
geometric operations upon those objects (e.g., distances). In the
following excercise we will analyse spatial relations of multiple
objects of different
types (polygons, lines, and points). The term "spatial join" refers to
performing a relational join on tables based on some spatial
criterion.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Nearest
neighbor</span>:
In the previous practical we found the 10 closest restaurants to a
particular restuarant using the SDO_DISTANCE function with a nested
SELECT statement. The same analysis can be performed using the nearest
neighbor function.
Doing so requires a spatial index. These indexes have already been
created for you, but normally you would create your own spatial index
on the "location" column of the us_restaurants table, as in previous
weeks' practicals.
Perform
the same analysis as in P3.1.1 using the following template (nearest
neighbor
operator):<br>
    <div class="example">SELECT
... FROM ... WHERE
... AND SDO_NN(analysis_spatialcolumn, origin_spatialcolumn)='TRUE' AND
ROWNUM &lt;=10;</div>
Note the simplified syntax of a typical spatial operator. The order of
the two geometry columns in the query is always preserved. Also note
that by adding a third parameter to the SDO_NN function (param1,
param2, 'SDO_NUM_RES=10') you can achieve the same result. This
restricts the number of nearest&nbsp;neighbors retrieved (referred
to
as the <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>-nearest
neighbors
problem). <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Closest
interstate</span>: Use
the techniques you have already learned to select the
interstate (highway) closest to the restaurant with ID 33625120. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Aggregation
of results: </span>Determine
the total area in square miles of US states with a population of more
than 15 million
people.
You will select spatial objects based on non-spatial attributes and
determine a joint spatial property. Use the&nbsp;SUM operator
together with the SDO_AREA function to get the total value.
    <div class="example">SELECT
SUM(expression) FROM ...</div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Relate
operation</span> #1:
We
want to find restaurants within Maryland,
using a spatial operation. We want only restaurants lying within
Maryland,
based on the geometry of the outline of Maryland. This can be achieved
using the SDO_RELATE
operator, which determines the spatial (topological) relationship
between two geometries:
    <div class="example">...
SDO_RELATE(geometry1,
geometry2,
'MASK=ANYINTERACT')='TRUE' ...;</div>
Note that the available interactions (masks) can be more restrictive
than ANYINTERACT (e.g., EQUAL, COVERS/COVEREDBY, INSIDE/CONTAINS,
TOUCH,
DISJOINT, OVERLAPBDYINTERSECT), and can also be combined
using the "+" function. For more information on the different
topological relationships supported by Oracle, refer to the lecture
notes or an Oracle Spatial reference source (such as Kothuri et al.,
2004).<br>
However, a brief description of the possible relationships is given
below (see <a
 href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2003/11/10/oracle_spatial.html?page=2">oreillynet.com</a>):
    <ul>
      <li> DISJOINT: the
boundaries and interiors do not
intersect </li>
      <li> TOUCH: the boundaries
intersect but the interiors do
not
intersect </li>
      <li> OVERLAPBDYDISJOINT: the
interior of one object
intersects
the
boundary and interior of the other object, but the two boundaries do
not intersect. This relationship occurs, for example, when a line
originates outside a polygon and ends inside that polygon. </li>
      <li> OVERLAPBDYINTERSECT:
the boundaries and interiors of
the two
objects intersect </li>
      <li> EQUAL: the two objects
have the same boundary and
interior </li>
      <li> CONTAINS: the interior
and boundary of one object is
completely contained in the interior of the other object </li>
      <li> COVERS: the interior of
one object is completely
contained
in
the interior of the other object and their boundaries intersect </li>
      <li> INSIDE: the opposite of
CONTAINS. A INSIDE B implies B
CONTAINS A. </li>
      <li> COVEREDBY: the opposite
of COVERS. A COVEREDBY B
implies B
COVERS A. </li>
      <li> ON: the interior and
boundary of one object is on the
boundary
of the other object (and the second object covers the first object).
This relationship occurs, for example, when a line is on the boundary
of a polygon. </li>
      <li> ANYINTERACT: the
objects are non-disjoint </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Relate </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">operation #2</span>:&nbsp;Find
all the
interstates and rivers that cross (anyinteract) the
state of New York.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Relate </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">operation #3</span>:&nbsp;Find
all the
states that border (touch) the state of New
York.http://www.lms.unimelb.edu.au<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Relate </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">operation #4</span>:
Retrieve the name of
the US state in which the "Wah Mee Restaurant" is located (contained),
based on the
coordinates of its location. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Relate </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">operation #5</span>:
List
all the states
which the "I95" interstate passes through.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Relate o</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">peration #6</span>:
List
all the
interstates which cross the "Potomac" river.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Relate </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">operation #7</span>:&nbsp;Find
all the
US states that border (touch) exactly one other US state. (This is
quite tricky!)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise P3.2: Retrieving
coordinate information<br>
</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>It
is
possible to retrieve
some of the
spatial&nbsp;parameters of spatial objects stored within
an SDO_GEOMETRY type in a straightforward way:
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Retrive
coordinate information</span>:
It is possible to retrieve the coordinates of a point geometry in a
straightforward way. List the lat, long values of restaurants within
New York state in a
table
containig columns NAME, X, Y. Hint: you have to use the
alias notation for the table, otherwise Oracle returns an error. The
general pattern of the query function for the coordinates x is:<br>
    <div class="example">SELECT
tablealias.geom_column.SDO_POINT.x FROM table tablealias ...;</div>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise P3.3: Overlay
operations<br>
</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>As
well as
using the relate
operation to find the relationship between two spatial objects, we can
combine spatial objects into new objects using set-based operators,
like intersection, union, and difference. <br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Union</span>:
The union of two
geometries can be constructed using the SDO_GEOM.SDO_UNION function,
with the template below. Create the region that is the union of France
and Germany.&nbsp; Output the lat/long coordinates of the centroid
of
the union of France and Germany. <br>
    <div class="example">SDO_GEOM.SDO_UNION(geometry1,
geometry2,
tolerance); </div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Intersection</span>
#1: The
intersection of two geometries can be constructed using a similar
function, as below. Find the intersection of the "I81" and the "St.
Lawrence" river.
    <div class="example">SDO_GEOM.SDO_INTERSECTION(geometry1,
geometry2, tolerance); </div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Intersection</span>
#2: Now
find the restaurant that is closest to the intersection of "I81" and
the "St. Lawrence" river (in one query). How far away is it (in miles)?<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Intersection</span>
#3: How far
away from the intersection of the "I81" and the
"St. Lawrence" river is the intersection of the "I95" and the Potomac?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
