<h2>P2:
Using Oracle
Spatial <br>
</h2>
<h3>Objectives<br>
</h3>
<p>By the end of this practical
you should be able to: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>understand Oracle spatial
data types; <br>
  </li>
  <li>retrieve information about
objects based on their spatial
properties; and</li>
  <li>create new spatial data.</li>
</ol>
This practical should require <span style="font-style: italic;">two
weeks</span> to complete. <br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This practical will introduce
you to the basics of spatial analysis in SQL. We will use the spatial
capabilities of Oracle 10g DBMS to perform basic spatial operations on
the sample
data from the US Census Bureau, the Digital Chart of the World
(covered
in Kothuri
et al., 2004), and some data created by yourself.<br>
</p>
<h3>Exercise P2.1: Viewing spatial
data<br>
</h3>
<p>Oracle Spatial has <span style="font-style: italic;">no
</span>spatial
data viewing capabilities. One of the reasons why Oracle Spatial is
such a powerful system is that unlike GIS software packages, Oracle
Spatial treats the storage, querying, and management of spatial data as
completely separate functions from viewing that data. However, when
learning about Oracle spatial it is occasionally nice to be to display
the data you are using graphically. There are many different ways that
you can view Oracle Spatial data, including web mapping using Oracle
Spatial MapViewer, and linking it to GIS software packages like GIS.
However, in this section we use a&nbsp;data viewer called Spatial
Console. Spatial Console is only available in University lab spaces.
However, there is an unsupported, free data viewer you can download
and use at home if you wish. Details are available on the course web
site.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Prepare data
to be viewed</span>:
Viewing spatial data in Spatial Console requires that the data is in
your schema, has metadata, and has an index. We shall look at creating
metadata and indexes later in this practical. However, for now simply
follow the steps below to prepare the world_continents data from the
"spatial" schema for viewing in Spatial Console. To view other data,
you may simply replace "world_continents" in the instructions below
with the name of another&nbsp;data set in the spatial schema.
However,
you have a limited disk quota and so some data sets may be too large to
store. When you have finished, you should always delete any data you
have copied using the "DROP TABLE"&nbsp;command. &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Log into your account
using SQL*Plus in the usual way</li>
    <li>Make a copy of
world_continents in your own schema using
the command "CREATE TABLE my_world_continents AS SELECT * FROM
spatial.world_continents"</li>
    <li>Copy across the metadata
for world_continents from
spatial's
schema using the command "INSERT INTO user_sdo_geom_metadata (SELECT
'my_world_continents', column_name, diminfo, srid FROM
all_sdo_geom_metadata WHERE&nbsp; table_name='WORLD_CONTINENTS' AND
owner='SPATIAL')"</li>
    <li>Create an index for the
data using the command "CREATE
INDEX world_continents_index ON my_world_continents(geom) INDEXTYPE IS
mdsys.spatial_index"</li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Start
Spatial Console</span>: The Oracle
Spatial data viewer is called Spatial Console and can be
started using the Spatial Console menu item in Windows.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Set
connection</span>: To view
any spatial data,&nbsp;Spatial Console&nbsp;first requires
information
about the
connecting to an Oracle server. Using the connection wizard, or by
selecting "Add" from the "Action" menu, must enter the details of the
connection to the Oracle server, as used in Practical 1.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The name can be anything
you want (e.g., 451235). </li>
    <li>The host is:
ploppa.ecr.unimelb.edu.au</li>
    <li>The port is: 1521</li>
    <li>The SID is: geomatics</li>
    <li>The username is: your
Oracle username from last week</li>
    <li>The password is: your
password from last week<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Set data to
view</span>:
You must also enter the data to
display. Each data set to display is referred to as a "layer" in
Spatial Console. With the "Layers" tab selected (right hand side of
screen) "Add" a new layer from the "Action" menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Select the connection
(e.g., 451235) from the pull down
menu</li>
    <li>Set the table name to be
the new data set copied from
spatial,
i.e., my_world_continents. Spatial Console should automatically
propagate the layer details with all the metadata for the data set</li>
    <li>Set the "Unique ID column"
to "ID". <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Layer caching</span>:
For small data sets you can answer "No" to the question "Would you like
to cache the layer?" <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Move around
the map</span>: The map should now
be displayed. The
icons at the top of the screen allow you to zoom and pan around the
data. Try this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Select
continents</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Spatial
Console also has a select function where you can select objects and
view the data associated with those objects. Work out how to achieve
this and explore any other capabilities of spatial viewer you can
find.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
</ol>
We shall not use the data viewer as the basis for future exercises. But
it is always there to allow you to graphically view,
explore, and perform simple queries on data if you wish. A free,
limited, trial version of the&nbsp;software
may also be downloaded via the course web site in case you want to use
it at home. <br>
<h3>Exercise P2.2: Overview of
spatial objects <br>
</h3>
This exercise will shows you how to get overview information about
a&nbsp;database's spatial data contents, using the SQL*Plus instant
client. You will retrieve information about the basic spatial
properties of objects described by the database. The focus is on the
geometry processing functions of Oracle. We will use the US
data from the Digital Chart of the World dataset.
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Login to the
course database server</span> (in <span style="font-style: italic;">Oracle
SQL*Plus
instant client</span>).
Log in to the server using technique covered in the last
practical.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get an
overview of the
available data</span>: List all the
data attributed to the owner
"Spatial" (this was covered in the last practical). Verify if
the&nbsp;following tables are present: world_continents,
world_countries, us_cities, us_interstates, us_parks, us_rivers,
us_states, us_restaurants.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Attributes
of
the&nbsp;table containing spatial data</span>:
Find out the
name of the column containing attributes of the spatial data type for
each of the tables listed above. Provide the answer in the form of a
SELECT
statement. HINT: The geometry columns in Oracle are of the
type&nbsp;SDO_GEOMETRY.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Information
about spatial
coordinates</span>: We will find out
some
basic&nbsp;information about the coordinate systems used to store
spatial objects. We will use
the state of New York (us_states.state_abrv='NY') and other US states.</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Find out
the type of the spatial object</span>:
one of the most important
information we need about a specific spatial object is what type of
object it is (point, line, polygon, ...). Find out what is the spatial
data type of the state of New York? Use the
following query template:
      <div class="example">SELECT
a.geom.SDO_GTYPE
geom FROM spatial.us_states a WHERE ...;</div>
Note the output of the geometry type. The format is D00T.&nbsp;2003
- '2' identifies the number of dimension of the spatial object (1,2,3
or 4 if temporal), '3' identifies the type of geometry (1 - point, 2 -
line, 6 - multiline, 3 - polygon, 7 - multipolygon,...). More
information about the codes used for geometry types is contained in the
lecture notes and in Kothuri
et al., 2004.<br>
HINT: note the use of the alias a for the table us_states. You can use
this technique in and SELECT statement to avoid
typing long identifiers. Also note the output, where the selected
information has a new assigned column name, GEOM. You can use this
approach for customized system outputs.</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Find out
the spatial reference system in which the geometry is defined</span>:
The SRID is a code specifying in what coordinate system the
spatial&nbsp;objects are stored. Find out what coordinate system
Georgia's coordinates are stored in. <br>
      <div class="example">SELECT
a.geom.SDO_SRID FROM
spatial.us_states a WHERE ...;</div>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Identify
the SRID used</span>: the cryptic
identifiers of the Oracle SRID
can be translated into standard notation and vice versa. Find out the
SRID code for the standard Australian Geodetic 1966 system used for the
official mapping.<br>
Hint: use the query as a template:
      <div class="example">SELECT
wktext FROM MDSYS.CS_SRS
WHERE srid='8307';</div>
You can use the columns wktext or cs_name to identify the coordinate
system. HINT: Use the&nbsp;SQL '<big><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">LIKE</span></big>'
operator, if you do not know the exact input string (you can use
'%pattern%' if you do want to match only a pattern and not the exact
string):&nbsp;
      <div class="example">SELECT
column_name1 FROM
table_name
WHERE column_name2 LIKE '%pattern%';</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Information
about spatial
properties</span>: In addition to
coordinates, we can find out a
variety of spatial information for our spatial data. <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Compute
area</span>s: Find
the area of the US state of
NY. HINT: to work with the geometries in Oracle, you have to provide a
spatial function and its parameter as arguments of the SELECT
statement. The usual template is: <big><code>SDO_FUNCTION
(parameter1,parameter2,...)</code></big>.
The area function
looks like this: <br>
      <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_GEOM.SDO_AREA
(geometry_column, tolerance, units) FROM ...</div>
The units parameter is optional. Set the tolerance to 1 (see below for
information about tolerance). Provide
the answer in both square yards and square meters in the same table
('unit=sq_yard' and
'unit=sq_meter'). Make sure you give the output columns sensible
headings. Once you've got the area of New York, write a query
to list the names of all US states, in descending order of area
(largest first). What is the fourth largest state?<br>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Compute
perimeter</span>s:
The function returning length for lines also returns the perimeter for
polygons. The function is <big><code>SDO_GEOM.SDO_LENGTH(geometry_column,
tolerance, units)</code></big>.
Find out the perimeter of
the state of
New York. Provide the answer in
meters and miles (in one query). Now write a query to list the names of
all US states, in descending order of perimeter (longest first). What
is the state with the fourth longest perimeter?&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Determine
the bounding box of a spatial object</span>:
Bounding boxes are
an important concept in spatial data handling. They provide the extent
of the object along the ordinates of the coordinate system
(northernmost point of a continent, and so on...). The function
SDO_MBR(geometry) returns the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) of a
geometry. Find the MBR of New York. You can also retrieve the
individual values along each dimension (x=1,
y=2, z=3; or lon, lat, height).
      <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_GEOM.SDO_MIN_MBR_ORDINATE
(geometry_column, dimension_no) FROM ...</div>
Retrieve the north-south extent of NY. Write a (single) SQL statement
to give the minimum and maximum latitude for each state. Label the
columns in your statement NAME, MAXLAT, and MINLAT. HINT:
Assign aliases to the outputs of the SELECT statement
      <div class="example">SELECT
(Function1
(parameters...)) alias1, (Function2
(parameters...)) alias2 from ...</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
The tolerance value (in P2.2.5a) is needed to specify the degree of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">precision </span>used
to
compute the
answer to several different spatial functions, including area. For
spatial data using geodetic coordinates, a tolerance value of 1 means
that only points further apart than 1m will be considered to be
distinct points. Setting the tolerance too large will result in strange
answers (where distinct points are "snapped" together). Setting the
tolerance too small will decrease the speed and efficiency of the
spatial operation. Happily, the gap between "too large" and "too small"
is usually very generous. In most cases, any tolerance from a wide
variety of values will result in efficient retrieval of the correct
answer. Repeat P2.2.5a with different tolerance values to reassure
yourself you get the same answer (try tolerances of 10, 100, 1000,
10000, 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, ...). Some spatial operations are more
sensitive to tolerance values than others. However, in this course it's
safe to always select the default tolerance of "1". <br>
<h3>Exercise P2.3: Spatial data
storage <br>
</h3>
In this exercise, you will define and create your own table with sample
spatial data. You will have to create a metadata entry for those
tables: all spatial data in oracle needs metadata to describe its
coordinate system. At the end
of the lab,
don't forget to remove the metadata entries, drop the table and
indexes. <br>
<ol>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  </ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Inserting
spatial data</span>: create a table
"petrolstation" with spatial
data in the column location. You will
create a table containing the coordinates of three "petrol stations",
with the following coordinates:<br>
    <table style="text-align: left; height: 204px; width: 407px;"
 border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="2">Name
(varchar2(8))</td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="2">ID
(NUMBER)</td>
          <td colspan="2" rowspan="1">SDO_GEOMETRY</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Lon</td>
          <td>Lat</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Agip</td>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>-77.01669</td>
          <td>33.90124</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Shell</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>-77.017</td>
          <td>33.90120</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Texaco</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>-77.018</td>
          <td>33.9013</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
HINT: Use the following template:<br>
    <div class="example">CREATE
TABLE petrolstation(<br>
name &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VARCHAR2(8),<br>
ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUMBER,<br>
location&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SDO_GEOMETRY<br>
);<br>
    <br>
INSERT INTO petrolstation VALUES (<br>
...., SDO_GEOMETRY(<br>
2001, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --SDO_GTYPE attribute specifying
points of dimension 2<br>
8307,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --other parameters of SDO_GEOMETRY,
set to 8307 for now<br>
SDO_POINT_TYPE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- point type
specification, coordinates follow<br>
(value1,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- value
of ordinate 1 (longitude)<br>
value2,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;-- value of ordinate 2 (latitude)&nbsp; <br>
NULL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 3rd ordinate, NULL if 2D object <br>
),<br>
NULL,<br>
NULL<br>
)<br>
);</div>
  </li>
Some of the codes and NULL values in the insert statement may seem a
bit strange. These values are all required by oracle to parameterize
the new geometry. The lectures will provide more information on which
codes to use and exactly what they mean. However, the Oracle Spatial
documentation and Kothuri et al. (2004) are definitive texts to refer
to if in doubt. Note the "--" notation. You can use it to insert
comments
into longer SQL statements for your own orientation. Try to store the
insert segment&nbsp;in a text document with the
extension *.sql. You can load it using:&nbsp;
  <div class="example">START
path_to_file.sql</div>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Create
metadata entry for the spatial table</span>:
Oracle spatial
treats all the objects with a spatial column in one table as a spatial
layer. If you insert metadata information about this layer in a
metadata table, Oracle will be able to create spatial indexes,
reproject data, and perform more advanced analysis on this objects.
Metadata information in Oracle spatial covers the type of the layer
(its
dimensions), its geographic bounds, tolerance, and spatial reference
system information.
    <div class="example">INSERT
INTO
user_sdo_geom_metadata VALUES(<br>
'PETROLSTATION', --table name<br>
'location', &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-- name of spatial
column<br>
SDO_DIM_ARRAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- DIMINFO attribute,
stores dimension bounds and tolerance<br>
(<br>
SDO_DIM_ELEMENT<br>
(<br>
'LONGITUDE', -- dimension name for first dimension<br>
-180,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- SDO_LB - lower bound of the dimension values<br>
180,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- upper bound for the dimension values<br>
0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- tolerance for values - 0.5 meters&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
),<br>
SDO_DIM_ELEMENT<br>
(<br>
'LATITUDE', -- dimension name for second dimension<br>
-90,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- SDO_LB - lower bound of the dimension values<br>
90,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- upper bound for the dimension values<br>
0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- tolerance for values - 0.5 meters&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
)<br>
),<br>
8307&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --
SRID value for WGS84<br>
);</div>
Verify the creation of the table by selecting its records. If you like,
you should also be able to view your new spatial data using the JBO
viewer. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise P2.4: Spatial
indexes&nbsp;</h3>
Spatial indexes speed up the
retrieval of spatial object based on their geometric properties, and
enable faster execution of some spatial analysis functions. Many
ingenious spatial indexes have been proposed, some of which we will
examine in more detail later in the course. However, it is not
necessary to understand how an index works in order to use it in
Oracle. In this section we will create an index for our spatial data.
Although you won't see and change to your data, creating an index is
required for many spatial analyses. (If you don't believe this, you
might like to try to skip ahead to P2.5.2 and see what happens!)
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Creation of
spatial index</span>:
Create a spatial index on the location column of the petrolstation
table using the following template:
    <div class="example">CREATE
INDEX indexname ON
tablename(spatial_column) INDEXTYPE IS MDSYS.SPATIAL_INDEX;</div>
It is recommended to always perform a:
    <div class="example">DROP
INDEX indexname;</div>
statement
for a specific index before creating a new one. Note that depending on
the nature of the spatial index (Quadtree,
R-tree, ...) after deletion/insertion of data in the table the index
may need to be re-created. Also, different geometric layouts of the
data
can justify the use of different indexes. The default index in Oracle
Spatial is the <span style="font-style: italic;">R-Tree</span>,
but
other indexes are also possible. R-trees, quadtrees, and many other
indexes will all be covered later in the course. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">List all
indexes</span>:
Sometimes it is useful to know which indexes have already been created.
The "user_indexes" table contains this information, as shown in the
following query:
    <div class="example">SELECT
index_name, table_name
FROM
user_indexes; </div>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise P2.5: Simple
geometric analysis</h3>
In this section we perform some simple geometric analyses covered in
the lectures. In the next practical we shall perform some more complex
analyses.<br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Querying
distances</span>:
The
distance between any geometry (point, line, or polygon) and point can
be determined using the function SDO_GEOM.SDO_DISTANCE(geom1, geom2,
tolerance, units). Note that in the case of the distance between a line
or polygon and a point the procedure retrieves the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">minimum </span>distance
(see lecture
notes for more information). For example, try the following query which
will provide the distance in miles between two of the petrol stations.
What are the distances between all pairs of the petrol stations?<br>
    <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_GEOM.SDO_DISTANCE(a.location,
b.location, 1, 'unit=mile') FROM petrolstation a, petrolstation b WHERE
a.name='Agip' and b.name='Texaco';<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Advanced
distance</span>:<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Select
the names of the 10
closest
restaurants from the restaurant POI_ID=33625120 (us_restaurants table).
The general template
for the distance clause is as for that above:
    <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_GEOM.SDO_DISTANCE(query_objects, origin_object,tolerance) FROM ...;</div>
However, you will need to use a nested statement and the operator
ROWNUM from Practical 1 to answer this question. Assign an alias
'DISTANCE' to the function
SDO_GEOM.SDO_DISTANCE and order by distance for the first subquery.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Within
distance</span>: We
can
also find places that are within a certain distance of each other
(assuming an index has been created) using the SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE
function. Try the following query, inserting a range of sensible values
in place of the distance "x": <br>
    <div class="example">SELECT
* FROM petrolstation a,
petrolstation
b
WHERE SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE(a.location, b.location, 'distance=x
unit=METER')='TRUE'; </div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Buffering</span>:
A buffer
creates a new geometry containing all the locations within a specified
distance of a input geometry. Create buffers of 1 mile around each of
the petrol stations, using the following template:<br>
    <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_GEOM.SDO_BUFFER(geometry,
distance,
tolerance, units) FROM ... </div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Centroid</span>:
We can
create
the centroid (center of gravity) for a polygonal shape using the
following template:
    <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_GEOM.SDO_CENTROID(geometry,
tolerance) ... </div>
Use this template to find the centroid of the buffer of 1000m for
the shell petrol station. What do you notice about this centroid and
why? <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Assessment A2: Spatial SQL</h3>
<h4>Marking</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Your submission will be
marked out of <span style="font-weight: bold;">10</span>,
with up to one
mark awarded per
question. <br>
  </li>
  <li>A perfect answer will be
awarded <span style="font-weight: bold;">1
mark</span>. A near-perfect answer
(almost exactly right, but
perhaps
with some slight mistake or missing step) may be awarded <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">half a mark</span>.
Anything else will be
awarded <span style="font-weight: bold;">0
marks</span>. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marks</span>
will be <span style="font-weight: bold;">deducted</span>
for any incorrect
submissions (e.g., using a Word or HTML document instead of a plain
text file; files that contain other than 10 answers with one answer or
comment per
line; answers not in the correct order; answers that contain non-SQL
parts, such as question numbers, or characters, such as double
quotation " marks instead of single quotation ' marks).<br>
  </li>
  <li>It is not possible to get
negative marks (e.g., an
assignment
score of 1 out of 10 with 2 marks deducted for incorrect submission
will be a final mark of 0, not -1).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Assignment</h4>
The questions you must answer for this assignment all concern the
sample
data from the US Census Bureau the Digital Chart of the World used in
the practicals. Your assignment is to
provide SQL/Oracle statements to
answer to the following 10 questions (see "Submission" section above
for more details). <br>
<ol>
  <li>List in alphabetical order
the country names and spatial object
geometry types (SDO_GTYPE) for all the countries
beginning with "An".</li>
  <li>List the spatial reference
system (SDO_SRID) in which the
coordinates of
Australia are stored.</li>
  <li>List the <span style="font-style: italic;">official</span>
name
(not wktext!) of the coordinate system with SRID 2236. </li>
  <li>List the country name (in
alphabetical order), area (in square
kilometers), perimeter (in kilometers), and the maximum latitudes of
all countries beginning with the letter "U". You must give your
column headings meaningful and concise aliases (i.e., "Area",
"Perimeter", "Maxlat"). <br>
  </li>
  <li>List the name, area (in
square meters, computed from the
geometry) and perimeter (in meters) of all
US states with populations
("totpop" attribute) of
more than 15 million people. Your list must be in decreasing order of
population (most
populous first) and must again use sensible aliases for your column
headings.</li>
  <li>Find the minimum distance in
miles from the city of
"Fresno"
("us_cities" table, "city" attribute) to the "Potomac" river
("us_rivers" table, "name" attribute).</li>
  <li>List the names, state
abbreviation, and distances (in miles) of all US cities
that are within 100 miles
of New York city. List your answer in order of
distance (nearest first). Note: you must use the SDO_GEOM.SDO_DISTANCE
function to answer this query instead of the SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE
function (because you do not have enough privileges to create the index
required for the SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE function for tables in the
"spatial" schema). <br>
  </li>
  <li>List the names of the cities
in the US state of "Oregon" in
order
of distance to the center (centroid) of the
state (closest first).</li>
  <li>Create a buffer of 100 miles
around the "Hudson" river.</li>
  <li>List in alphabetical order
the names of the countries whose s have areas
that
are more than 15% larger than the area reported in the
"sqmi_cntry" attribute of the "world_countries" table.</li>
</ol>
