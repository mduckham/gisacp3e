<h2>P1:
Introduction to SQL<br>
</h2>
<h3>Objectives<br>
</h3>
<p>By the end of this practical
you should be able to: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>log into an Oracle
database;</li>
  <li>perform basic
operations on selected tables; and <br>
  </li>
  <li>retreive
information from the database using SQL.</li>
</ol>
This practical should require <span style="font-style: italic;">two
weeks</span> to complete. <br>
<h3>Overview<br>
</h3>
<p>This practical will introduce
you to the basic elements of the Structured Query Language (SQL) and
you will learn how to interact with the Oracle 10g DBMS. The practical
will use an Oracle 10g database containing sample
data from the US Census Bureau and the Digital Chart of the World
(covered
in Kothuri
et al., 2004). In this tutorial only non-spatial operations will be
covered. <br>
</p>
<h3>Exercise P1.1: Using SQL*Plus <br>
</h3>
This exercise will cover the basics of connecting to
an Oracle database through the SQL*Plus instant client, and will enable
you to get an overview of the data available. Interacting directly with
the Oracle DBMS through the SQL*Plus command line
interface will help to get the grasp of the SQL syntax and is a basic
technique we shall be using over coming weeks. <br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Run Oracle
SQL*Plus instant client</span>: In
the practical labs, the
SQL*Plus client can be started from the Windows Start menu (under
"Departments", "Geomatics", "Oracle"). On some other machines to start
the
sqlplus client, you will need
to run the executable file sqlplus.exe. The exact location of this file
may vary from machine to machine, but is often located in the <code>c:\oraclient</code>
directory. You can run this file using Windows
file manager or the command line. You should be presented with a new
command line window and
the <code>SQL&gt;</code>
prompt. If not, and
you a "login" prompt, start a new command line prompt (Start menu
-&gt;
run -&gt; "cmd"), and change to
your sqlpus client directory (e.g., cd <code>c:\oraclient</code>)
and
type <code>sqlplus /nolog</code>.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Login to the
course database server</span>: The
course uses a remote database
server
hosted in the geomatics department. To log in to the server you need
the following details:</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>loginname:
&lt;information supressed for public version&gt;<br>
    </li>
    <li>password:&nbsp;&lt;information
supressed for public version&gt;</li>
    <li>databasename:&nbsp;&lt;information
supressed for public version&gt; </li>
    <li>serveraddress:&nbsp;&lt;information
supressed for public version&gt;</li>
  </ol>
To log in, at the <code>SQL&gt;</code>
prompt type the
following
(substituting the correct information from above). When you log in for
the first time, the system will require you to set a new password. Do
this, and remember your password for future weeks. <br>
  <div class="example">CONNECT
loginname/password@//serveraddress:1521/databasename </div>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get an
overview of the
available data</span>: When first
logging in a new database, it
is good
to get the overview of the available data. Execute the statement:</li>
  <div class="example">SELECT
owner, table_name FROM
all_tables;&nbsp; </div>
This statement will list all the data tables already available to
you in the teaching database, along with the "owner" of these
tables. You will start with no tables of your own, but many tables will
still be available for you to query. In particular, those owned by
"spatial" are the ones we shall be using in this course. Note
the pattern of the SELECT statement below (see the lecture notes or
http://www.w3schools.com/sql for more information; square brackets
below indicate optional clauses). Using this pattern, try to
refine the SELECT statement above to show only those tables owned by
"spatial". Ask for guidance from the demonstrators if you get stuck at
this point.&nbsp;
  <div class="example">SELECT
[ DISTINCT | ALL ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; column_expression1, column_expression2,
....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ FROM from_clause ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ WHERE where_expression ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ GROUP BY expression1, expression2,
.... ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ HAVING having_expression ]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ORDER BY order_column_expr1,
order_column_expr2,
...];<br>
  </div>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Table
description</span>:
To get
the description of the data
available in a specific table, use the DESCRIBE statement. The
DESCRIBE statement has the syntax:&nbsp;</li>
  <div class="example">DESCRIBE
owner.tablename</div>
Get the description of the "us_cities" table (owner "spatial"). What
does the output
mean? <li><span style="font-style: italic;">View
records of a
table</span>: Issue SELECT
statements
allowing you to view the records of the "us_cities" table. Note that
because this table is not owned by you, you will need to use the form
"owner.tablename" whenever you refer to it in any SQL statement, like
SELECT.&nbsp;</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Use the * operator to
select all the records.</li>
    <li>Select the record of the
city of Richmond.</li>
    <li>Select the population
(column pop90) of the city
of Richmond (projection operation).</li>
  </ol>
You <span style="font-style: italic;">must</span>
prefix an
attribute reference with
the table name (for example, us_cities.pop90) whenever the attribute
name appears in more than one
table in the FROM clause (to resolve any ambiguities). You <span
 style="font-style: italic;">may</span>
use this format
even when the
attribute name is unique in the tables you are querying, to be on the
safe side.&nbsp; <li>Disconnnect
from the database. Use the
command
DISCONNECT to
disconnect from the database. Re-connect using the
command connect and your connection string as specified earlier and try
the EXIT command. Note the difference.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise P1.2: Further SQL</h3>
In the previous exercise you have aquired familiarity with the Oracle
SQL*Plus instant client and the basic SQL command, SELECT. In this
exercise you will learn additional commands and perform some basic
non-spatial data analysis. We will look at nested SELECT statements and
restrictions in SELECT statements. In addition to your lecture notes,
you may need to refer to an SQL syntax guide to help you answer some of
the following questions. There are many books on the subject, and the
web site <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql">http://www.w3schools.com/sql</a>
provides an excellent, simple, and accessible tutorial for all the SQL
functions covered in this practical. <br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">List all the
US cities in
alphabetical order</span>: HINT: Use
the ORDER BY operator. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Count the US
cities in
California with a population of greater than 150000</span>:
HINT:
The
state abbreviation for California is CA. You need to use the COUNT
keyword and the AND keyword to chain conditions. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get the
population of the
largest city in Texas</span>: HINT:
Try using the MAX operator.
The
state abbreviation for Texas is TX. </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get the name
of the city with
the largest population in Texas</span>:
HINT: You will probably
need to
use a <span style="font-style: italic;">nested</span>
SELECT query to
achieve this. When nesting a select query you enclose the entire
subquery in parenthesis (brackets). </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">List the 100
most populous US
cities</span>: HINT: The "most
populous" cities means those with
the
highest population. There are at least two ways to do this. The
simplest can
be found by looking closely at the results of describing the table for
US cities. Another more complex way is to use the special SQL variable
"ROWNUM" in
the WHERE clause of your SELECT statement to select only those records
higher that a particular row number. However, check your answer
carefully as you must be certain to order your cities by population <span
 style="font-style: italic;">before</span>
using ROWNUM
to restrict
your answer to only those most populous cities. Your list should be
sorted in
descending order (most populous first). <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get the
number of different
states which contain the 100 most populous US cities</span>:
HINT: The
answer requires the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">different
    </span>states,
so two or more cities in the same state only
count
once.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Note that the value of a <span style="font-style: italic;">string</span>
(Oracle data type varchar) in a SELECT statement must be always
enclosed single quotes, e.g., 'value'.<br>
<h3>Exercise P1.3: Data entry and
join queries<br>
</h3>
In this exercise, you will define and create your own table with sample
data; add and modify the data entries; and finally delete ("drop")
the table. All the queries in the previous exercise concern the values
in a single
table (us_cities). The queries in this exercise are <span
 style="font-style: italic;">join </span>queries,
where the answers
can only be found by combining information across multiple tables
within a single SELECT statement.
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Create the
table "directory"</span>:
Create a new table containing the name of a company, city, product
name, and number of items sold. The items column will be an integer of
length 3. Table creation is achieved using the "CREATE" statement. The
relation
scheme for your table is: <br>
  </li>
  <div class="example">directory(company:
VARCHAR2(32),
city:
VARCHAR2(32),
product_name: VARCHAR2(32),
no_of_items: NUMBER)</div>
What are the candidate keys for your new table? What should be the
primary key for this table? <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Enter
10 data records for your
table</span>: HINT: Data entry is
achieved using the SQL "INSERT"
statement. You can invent whatever data you want, except for the "city"
attribute, which must contain only names of cities from the "us_cities"
table (at least two different names). You should also have at least two
different products sold by at least two different companies.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">List the
names of products
along with the abbreviations for states they are sold in</span>:
HINT:
this is a join
query requiring you
to join your new "directory" table with the "us_cities" table, using
the join field "city" on both tables. If you encounter problems, make
sure the city names in the "city" column of your new "directory" table
are spelt correctly, and are <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly
    </span>as
they appear in the "us_cities" table.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">List the
total number of sales
by state</span>: HINT: this is
another join query requiring the
use of
the "GROUP BY" SQL keywords.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">List the
total number of
products sold by city</span>: This
is similar to the previous
query. <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get the
population of the city
which has the company that sold
most of the products</span>: This
requires an extension of the
previous
query, using a nested SELECT statement.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Update one
of your directory
records with new sales data</span>:
Suppose it is Christmas and
one of
your companies has just sold a lot of one of your products in a
particular city. Use the "UPDATE" statement to increase the number of
items sold for that records. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Delete the
company that sold
the least amount of the products
from the table</span>: Suppose an
underperforming company has be
sold.
Delete all the records in the table for the company that has in total
the lowest number of sales. HINT: Use the SQL "DELETE" statement. This
query can be achieved using <span style="font-style: italic;">one </span>nested
SQL query!<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Drop the
"directory</span><span style="font-style: italic;">"
table</span>: When you are finished,
you
should delete the "directory" table using the "DROP" SQL statement. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Assessment A1: SQL Foundations</h3>
<h4>Assignment</h4>
The questions you must answer for your first assignment all concern the
tables "us_cities" (familiar from practical 1) and "us_states"
(contains demographic data for US states) which may both be accessed
from the course database, using the same techniques as in the practical
exercises. Your assignment is to provide SQL/Oracle statements to
answer to the following
10 questions (see "Submission" section above
for more details). <br>
<ol>
  <li>Describe the "us_states"
table.</li>
  <li>List all the states names
and state abbreviations for those US
states with a total land area greater than 100,000 square miles
("landsqmi" column). Order the list in descending
order of total land area (largest area first). <br>
  </li>
  <li>List the names of states
that have a greater percentage of their
population
at retirement age (from ages 60 and 64, "pct60_64" column) than
teenagers (from 14
and 17 years old, "pct14_17" column). <br>
  </li>
  <li>List in alphabetical order
the names of states that have a
population density of less than 10 people per square mile ("poppsqmi"
column). Note that some states
have no data for total area or population density (listed with zero
"landsqmi" and "poppsqmi"). These states will need to be omitted from
your listing. <br>
  </li>
  <li>List the names of US cities
that begin with the letters "Sa"
along with the <span style="font-style: italic;">name</span>
of the
state (not the state
abbreviation) in which each city is located. Order your list in
ascending order of state name (i.e., "A" first).</li>
  <li>Get the total number of
cities in the US with populations
that account for more than 20% of the total population for the state in
which each city is located. The "pop90" column gives the populations of
cities in the us_cities table, while the "totpop" column gives the
total population of states in the us_states table.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Cities in the us_cities
table are ranked according to population
(rank90). Display a table that lists each state abbreviation along with
the ranks of the highest and lowest ranking cities&nbsp;in that
state in terms of
population. Order your table in alphabetical
order of state abbreviation.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Create a new table with the
following relation scheme:
mystates(state: VARCHAR(32), state_abrv: VARCHAR(2), totpop: NUMBER). <br>
  </li>
  <li>Populate your new table with
appropriate data from the us_states
table for only the 20 largest states in terms of population.</li>
  <li>Delete your new mystates
table. </li>
