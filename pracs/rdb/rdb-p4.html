<h2>P4:
Network Analysis<br>
</h2>
<h3>Objectives<br>
</h3>
<p>By the end of this practical
you should be able to: <br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>create and retrieve
information about objects based on their
spatial
relations in networks;<br>
  </li>
  <li>perform specific network
analysis tasks; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>write simple PL/SQL code to
execute SQL-based procedures and
routines. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
This practical should require <span style="font-style: italic;">two
weeks</span> to complete. <br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This practical will introduce
you to the basics of spatial analysis of networks in SQL. We will use
the spatial
capabilities of Oracle 10g DBMS. Basic spatial operations in networks
will be
covered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spatial networks are sets of
nodes connected by edges, such as might
be used to represent cities
connected by roads or railways. In network models, the Euclidean
distance between nodes does not have to equal the network distance.
Edges (links) in the network may be directed or
undirected. In addition to connectivity, networks in Oracle Spatial
have geometric information associated with them (for instance,
geographic
coordinates of the nodes).</p>
Some of the excercises will use the Procedural Language (PL) extension
of the SQL language from Oracle. PL enables you to run more complex,
structured programs with conditions, loops, etc. The basic structure
of a PL/SQL <span style="font-style: italic;">block</span>
is:
<div class="example">DECLARE<br>
/*optional */<br>
/*this is a comment */<br>
BEGIN<br>
/*core section of the block, compulsory*/<br>
EXCEPTION<br>
/*Error handling,... Optional*/<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*
this
runs the program*/</div>
<h3>Exercise P4.1: Network data
entry<br>
</h3>
Spatial networks are sets of nodes connected by edges, such as cities
connected by roads or railways. In network models, the Euclidean
distance between nodes is not necessarily equal to the network
distance. In this exercise, we will create a simple
network, fill it with data, and perform some basic analysis.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Login to the
course database server</span> (in <span style="font-style: italic;">Oracle*SQL
instant client</span>).
Log in to the server using the same connection string as in previous
practicals.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Network
creation: </span>There
are several ways to create a network in Oracle. We will use the
automatic way, which lets Oracle create all the necessary table
structures with the procedure SDO_NET.CREATE_SDO_NETWORK.&nbsp;The
parameters to this procedure provide the name of the network
("tutorial"), the number of
hierarchical levels (1), whether the graph is directed (true), and
whether costs
are assigned to nodes (false). Use the following PL procedure to create
the
empty tutorial network:<br>
    <div class="example">exec
SDO_NET.CREATE_SDO_NETWORK
('tutorial',1,true,false)</div>
This automated procedure also creates all the necessary entries in the
network metadata tables. It does not, however, create entries in the
spatial metadata tables in case of a spatial network. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Get an
overview of the
available data structures</span>:
Verify that
the&nbsp;following tables are present and describe their
structure:
TUTORIAL_NODE$,&nbsp;TUTORIAL_LINK$,&nbsp;TUTORIAL_PATH$
and&nbsp;TUTORIAL_PLINK$. Detailed description of some of the
columns can be found by referring to the lecture notes and to other
documentation (e.g., Kothuri et al. 2004).<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span>
The tables
containing "paths" and "plinks" will not be used for the timebeing, so
can be ignored.
Validate the network created through the following command:
    <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_NET.VALIDATE_NETWORK
('tutorial') FROM DUAL;</div>
  </li>
The only errors should be those indication missing spatial ("geom")
metadata. Note that "DUAL" is just a dummy table necessary to make the
SELECT statement run. <br>
  <li><img src="figure4-1.png" alt=""
 style="width: 580px; height: 277px; float: right;" vspace="5"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Input of
network data: </span>We will fill
the network "tutorial" with
the network provided in the figure on the right. For convenience, where
two links connect a pair of nodes in opposite directions, one link is
preceded with a negative sign (e.g., L6 connects N8 to N7; -L6 connects
N7 to N8). The costs of
the links are shown in the figure (all links in opposite directions
connecting the same nodes have equal costs). No costs are
assigned to nodes. The (non-geographical) coordinates of the nodes are
indicated on the margins of the figure.</li>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Populate
the node table</span>: Use the
following template to populate the
table with node data (note that the SRID parameter is NULL):
      <div class="example">INSERT
INTO tutorial_node$
(node_id, node_name, geometry) VALUES (1,'N1',SDO_GEOMETRY(2001,NULL,
SDO_POINT_TYPE(0,2,NULL),NULL,NULL)<br>
);</div>
Remember to execute the COMMIT command at the end of all major
operations to save your data. Because these commands are relatively
repetitive and you are almost certain to make a mistake or two
initiall, it is essential to construct your commands in a text editor
(like notepad) using cut-and-paste. Then execute your commands
using the "start" command (as in previous weeks). In case your get
stuck and want to completely restart the
creation of the network, drop the network with the command:
      <div class="example">exec
SDO_NET.DROP_NETWORK('NETWORK_NAME');</div>
before trying to re-create it again. Sometimes it is necessary to also
issue a "PURGE RECYCLEBIN" command before recreating the network.<br>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Populate
the link table</span>: Now populate
the
tutorial_link$ table with link data. You need to enter data for the
columns link_id, link_name,
start_node_id, end_node_id, cost, and geometry. Inputing links follows
the template below. Note that the <span style="font-style: italic;">direction
      </span>of
edges is significant (e.g., an edge from N2 to N1 is
different from an edge from N1 to N2):&nbsp;
      <div class="example">INSERT
INTO tutorial_link$
(link_id, link_name, start_node_id, end_node_id, cost, geometry) VALUES<br>
(1,'L1',2,1,1,<br>
SDO_GEOMETRY
(2002,NULL,NULL,<br>
SDO_ELEM_INFO_ARRAY
(1,2,1),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --
Straight line string element info <br>
SDO_ORDINATE_ARRAY (1,2,0,2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --
Coodinates for link<br>
));</div>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Verification
of the network</span>: Oracle offers
several commands to verify
the entry of the data in your network. You can retrieve the information
about the nodes, links, non-connected nodes and invalid
links.&nbsp;
      <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_NET.GET_NO_OF_NODES('network_name') FROM DUAL;</div>
Other commands include .GET_NO_OF_LINKS(network_name),
.GET_ISOLATED_NODES(network_name),
.GET_INVALID_LINKS(network_name),
.GET_LINK_DIRECTION(network_name,link_id). Verify
that your network has 9 nodes and 15 links, with no isolated nodes or
invalid links.</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Finding
information about individual elements of the network</span>:
Finally, it is possible to retrieve basic topological information about
the
elements of the network as such. This is important information for
verifying that the network connectivity is correct. The basic measures
are
node degree (total number of links incident with a node). Node
in/out-degree is the number of incoming and outgoing links from a
specific node respectively (therefore for any node n,
degree(n)=in_degree(n)+out_degree(n)). The basic commands all follow
the same
consistent pattern:
      <div class="example">SELECT
SDO_NET.GET_NODE_DEGREE('network_name', node_id) FROM DUAL;</div>
The other commands are: .GET_NODE_IN_DEGREE, .GET_NODE_OUT_DEGREE,
.GET_IN_LINKS, .GET_OUT_LINKS. Build an SQL statement to list all the
nodes in numerical order along with their degree, in-degree, and
out-degree. Make sure your output looks exactly like the following
table.
(Note: you can use the SQL*Plus command "COLUMN node_name FORMAT a9" to
reformat the display of the node_name column so it fits neatly on your
screen.)<br>

<h3>Exercise P4.2: Network
analysis using Network Editor<br>
</h3>
Once the network is created, we can start to perform network analyses.
Oracle
provides a Network Editor application which we shall use in this
exercise to help familiarize yourself with the available network
analyses. You won't be able to view the network you have just created,
since we didn't give it the necessary spatial reference information and
metadata. However,
you will be able to build and analyse your own networks, and you should
be aware that you can also use Network Editor to connect to Oracle and
display existing spatial networks in the database. &nbsp;
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Start Network Editor</span>:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span>On
lab computers, the Network
Editor can be started via the
Windows start menu. Start the Network Editor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Create a new network</span>:
Create a new SDO network from the "Edit", "Create new network..." menu
item. Note that you can change a variety of parameters for your
network. Call your network "mynet," and then press the "create"
button.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Add nodes to the network</span>:
Add the nodes roughly as in the figure above. Each node can be created
by selecting "Edit", "Add new node to network...", entering any
additional information your node may require, and then pressing
"Create". <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Add links to the network</span>:
Add the links to the network, again as in the figure above. Each link
can be created by selecting "Edit", "Add new link to the network...".
Note that you don't have to type in the IDs for every pair node which a
link connects. Simply select the nodes where you want your new link to
start and end in the editor window.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Turn labels on</span>:
From the
"view" menu turn the node and link labels on. Make sure you understand
what you are looking at. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Compute the shortest path</span>:
From the "Analysis" menu, you can access a variety of analyses. For
example, compute the shortest path from node 4 to node 2. What is it's
cost? Check with your neighbors? Do you all have the same routes/costs?
If not, why not? What is the cost of the shortest path from node 2 to
4? <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Experiment with other
network
analyses</span>: Use the Network
Editor "Analysis" menu to experiment
with some other network analyses. What do these different analyses do? <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise P4.3: Network
analysis using PL/SQL<br>
</h3>
Network analysis is also possible using the&nbsp;Java
API for Oracle (which the Network Editor uses) or in PL/SQL. Learning
Java is beyond the focus of
this course, so we will&nbsp;use&nbsp;simple PL/SQL scripts to
analyse the network in a similar way to using the Network Editor.
PL/SQL procedures are far
too complex to type in directly to the command line. From this point
onwards, if you are not already doing so, you must type your exercise
answers into a text file, for example using notepad, and then run this
file with the "start" command. Note that earlier statements which began
with the "exec" keyword (like "exec SDO_NET.CREATE_SDO_NETWORK
('tutorial',1,true,false)") can still be used in a PL/SQL procedure by
omitting the "exec" keyword (simply "SDO_NET.CREATE_SDO_NETWORK
('tutorial',1,true,false)"). You will need to use this fact to complete
your
assessment. <br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Loading the network in a
cache
memory</span>: To perform network
analysis in PL/SQL, it is necessary
to first load the network in a
cache memory. This creates a <span style="font-style: italic;">network
memory object</span>. Loading the
network can be
performed using the following command (replace "network_name" with
"tutorial"):
    <div class="example">BEGIN<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
SDO_NET_MEM.NETWORK_MANAGER.READ_NETWORK('network_name','TRUE');<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
    </div>
Note that every PL/SQL program is executed only after the two lines,
the first containing only a single dot ".", the second containing the
command "run;". It is also possible to use the character "/" in place
of these two lines (although "/" behaves slightly differently in some
circumstances). Note also, it is easy to forget the semicolon after
"END;". If you do this your code will not execute properly. If
the command executes successfully, you should see the lines of your
code printed out, followed by the output: "PL/SQL
procedure successfully completed." Any other messages will be errors.
If you receive an error, double check you have correctly entered the
procedure. Then ask a demonstrator for assistance. Also
execute the following SQL command to ensure server system listings
in the following excercises:<br>
    <div class="example">SET
SERVEROUTPUT ON FORMAT WRAP; </div>
Bear in mind that you can have only one network in memory at a time. To
drop the memory cache at the end of network processing
use the PL/SQL command:<br>
    <div class="example">BEGIN<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SDO_NET_MEM.NETWORK_MANAGER.DROP_NETWORK('network_name');<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run;</div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Connectivity</span>:
It is
possible that a network consists of several
mutually disconnected sub-networks. To find out how many individual
sub-networks the network contains, it is useful to get the number of
connected components:
    <div class="example">DECLARE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; res_numeric NUMBER;<br>
BEGIN<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
res_numeric :=
SDO_NET_MEM.NETWORK_MANAGER.FIND_CONNECTED_COMPONENTS('network_name');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The number of connected components is: ' ||
res_numeric);<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run; <span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
Note the declaration of variables and their types, as well as the
special output line for outputting information to the system console in
a formatted manner.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Neighborhood
analysis in networks</span>: To
retrieve the nearest neighbors of a
node,
follow the template below. Also find the nearest three nodes for node
4.&nbsp;
    <div class="example">DECLARE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; res_array SDO_NUMBER_ARRAY;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; res_numeric NUMBER;<br>
BEGIN<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; res_array :=
SDO_NET_MEM.NETWORK_MANAGER.NEAREST_NEIGHBORS('network_name',6,3);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('IDs for the
nearest 3
neighbors of node 6
are: ');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR indx IN
res_array.FIRST..res_array.LAST<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
LOOP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
res_numeric := res_array(indx);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT(SDO_NET_MEM.PATH.GET_END_NODE_ID('network_name',res_numeric)
|| ',');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
END LOOP;<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Shortest path</span>:
One of
the most important network analysis operations is the shortest path.
The shortest path
between a source and destination node is the path with the lowest cost.
More advanced shortest paths can take account of costs of turns and
node
traversal, but in our example only the costs of links are considered.
The following code will retrieve the cost of the shortest path. Adapt
it to find the cost of the path between nodes 4 and 2. Make sure that
you the answer you get agrees with the answer you found in 4.2.6. <br>
    <div class="example">DECLARE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost NUMBER;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path_id NUMBER;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; res_numeric NUMBER;<br>
BEGIN<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path_id :=
sdo_net_mem.network_manager.shortest_path('network_name',
source_node_id,
dest_node_id);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost :=
SDO_NET_MEM.PATH.GET_COST('network_name', path_id);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The ID of the
shortest path from X to Y is: '
|| path_id || ' and it costs ' ||&nbsp;cost);<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Further PL/SQL analysis</span>:
Given the following PL/SQL functions, and based on previous examples,
you should be able to create a program that returns the
names of all the links in the network, and their start and end nodes,
in a "table" with columns LINK/START_NODE/END_NODE. The listing
should be similar in structure to that in P4.3.4 above:<br>
    <div class="example">SDO_NET_MEM.LINK.GET_NAME(<br>
net_mem IN VARCHAR2,<br>
link_id IN NUMBER<br>
) RETURN VARCHAR2;<br>
    <br>
SDO_NET_MEM.LINK.GET_START_NODE_ID(<br>
net_mem IN VARCHAR2,<br>
link_id IN NUMBER<br>
) RETURN NUMBER;<br>
    <br>
SDO_NET_MEM.LINK.GET_END_NODE_ID(<br>
net_mem IN VARCHAR2,<br>
link_id IN NUMBER<br>
) RETURN NUMBER;</div>
HINT: Use the following template to determine all the link IDs in the
network:<br>
    <div class="example">var1_array
:=
SDO_NET_MEM.PATH.GET_LINK_IDS('network_name', res_numeric);<br>
FOR indx1 IN var1_array.FIRST..var1_array.LAST<br>
LOOP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var1_numeric := var1_array(indx1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT(var1_numeric || ' ');<br>
END LOOP;</div>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Reachable nodes</span>:
Write
another program to retrieve all the nodes reachable from a
specified node (5), using the template:<br>
    <div class="example">res_array
:=
SDO_NET_MEM.NETWORK_MANAGER.FIND_REACHABLE_NODES('tutorial',5);</div>

<h3>Exercise P4.4: Printing output
in PL/SQL<br>
</h3>
We've already seen in previous exercises the use of the
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE function to output the value of PL/SQL variables
to the screen. However, in PL/SQL it's not possible to directly output
the results of a SELECT statement to the screen. Thus, the following
SQL code will produce an error:<br>
<div class="example">
BEGIN <br>
&nbsp; SELECT id, name FROM my_table;<br>
END<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
</div>
Instead, you can copy <span style="font-style: italic;">single </span>values
from a SELECT statement into a
variable, and then print those out using the following template: <br>
<div class="example">
BEGIN <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
SELECT count(id) INTO x FROM my_table;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(x);<br>
END<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
</div>
However, to print out all the values from a table of results returned
from a SELECT statement, you need the following syntax which puts each
line from the SELECT statement into the "rec" record variable, and then
prints out elements from this record. <br>
<div class="example">BEGIN <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; FOR rec IN (SELECT id a, name b FROM
my_table)&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOOP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(rec.a || ', ' ||
rec.b); <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END LOOP;<br>
END<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
</div>
Try printing out some more values inside your PL/SQL procedures. Repeat
P4.1.3d, formatting the information about nodes and their degrees,
using a PL/SQL procedure. <br>
<h3>Assessment A4: Network Analysis<br>
</h3>
<h4>Assignment</h4>
<img alt="Assessment figure" src="figure4-2.png"
 style="width: 387px; height: 186px; float: right;">This
assignment
concerns the network shown in the figure on the right. Your assignment
is to provide a script to answer the following 10 questions. It is <span
 style="font-style: italic;">essential </span>that
your entire script run correctly using the "start" command in SQL*Plus
(e.g., "start &lt;studentno&gt;.txt"). If it does not run
correctly,
the
markers will not debug your script and will give you zero marks for any
questions that don't work. You should also check very
carefully that your script creates network <span
 style="font-style: italic;">exactly </span>as
shown in the Figure.
Note that the coordinates of each node are provided in parenthesis
after the node name, e.g., "<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>
(7,1)". The numbers associated with the links are the costs for those
links. Note also that the links in this case do not have specified
labels: you may call them any sensible names. Where two links go in
both directions between the same pair of nodes, these links have the
same costs (e.g., cost(<span style="font-style: italic;">ih</span>)=cost(<span
 style="font-style: italic;">hi</span>)=25).
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new network called
"assessment4" (see hint below).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Create the nodes for this
network, as shown in the figure. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Create the links for this
network, as shown in the figure.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Print out the number of
nodes and links.</li>
  <li>Print out the names of every
node, along with their degree, in
degree,
and out degree. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Load the network into memory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Print out the number of
connected components in the network. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Print out the length of the
shortest path from node <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>
to <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>.</li>
  <li>Print out the names of the
five nearest neighbor nodes from node <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>.</li>
  <li>Drop the network, deleting
all tables associated with this
network.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Hint</h4>
Note: for questions 1 and 10, a problem may arise because the
SDO_CREATE_NETWORK and SDO_DROP_NETWORK functions can take some time to
execute and are multi-threaded, meaning that subsequent statements may
be executed
before the network has been created, leading to errors. To avoid this
problem, you should use the following general structure for your
assessed assignment to guarantee that the network has been created
before further statements are executed and deleted only after earlier
statements have been executed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div class="example">BEGIN <br>
&nbsp; /* Your answer to question 1 (create network) */<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
DECLARE<br>
&nbsp; /* Your variables */<br>
BEGIN <br>
&nbsp; /* Your answers to questions 2-9 */<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
BEGIN <br>
&nbsp; /* Your answer to question 10 (drop network in memory and on
the
disk) */<br>
END;<br>
.<br>
run;<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
